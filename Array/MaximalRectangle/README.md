This problem have two solutions. The first is DP solution. Cited from https://leetcode.com/discuss/20240/share-my-dp-solution
```

The DP solution proceeds row by row, starting from the first row. Let the maximal rectangle area at row i and column j be computed by [right(i,j) - left(i,j)]*height(i,j).

All the 3 variables left, right, and height can be determined by the information from previous row, and also information from the current row. So it can be regarded as a DP solution. The transition equations are:

left(i,j) = max(left(i-1,j), curleft), curleft can be determined from the current row
right(i,j) = min(right(i-1,j), curright), curright can be determined from the current row
height(i,j) = height(i-1,j) + 1, if matrix[i][j]=='1';
height(i,j) = 0, if matrix[i][j]=='0'
The code is as below. The loops can be combined for speed but I separate them for more clarity of the algorithm.

class Solution {public:
int maximalRectangle(vector<vector<char> > &matrix) {
    if(matrix.empty()) return 0;
    const int m = matrix.size();
    const int n = matrix[0].size();
    int left[n], right[n], height[n];
    fill_n(left,n,0); fill_n(right,n,n); fill_n(height,n,0);
    int maxA = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<m; i++) {
        int cur_left=0, cur_right=n; 
        for(int j=0; j<n; j++) { // compute height (can do this from either side)
            if(matrix[i][j]=='1') height[j]++; 
            else height[j]=0;
        }
        for(int j=0; j<n; j++) { // compute left (from left to right)
            if(matrix[i][j]=='1') left[j]=max(left[j],cur_left);
            else {left[j]=0; cur_left=j+1;}
        }
        // compute right (from right to left)
        for(int j=n-1; j>=0; j--) {
            if(matrix[i][j]=='1') right[j]=min(right[j],cur_right);
            else {right[j]=n; cur_right=j;}    
        }
        // compute the area of rectangle (can do this from either side)
        for(int j=0; j<n; j++)
            maxA = max(maxA,(right[j]-left[j])*height[j]);
    }
    return maxA;
}
};

If you think this algorithm is not easy to understand, you can try this example:

0 0 0 1 0 0 0 
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
The vector "left" and "right" from row 0 to row 2 are as follows

row 0:

l: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0
r: 7 7 7 4 7 7 7
row 1:

l: 0 0 2 3 2 0 0
r: 7 7 5 4 5 7 7 
row 2:

l: 0 1 2 3 2 1 0
r: 7 6 5 4 5 6 7
The vector "left" is computing the left boundary. Take (i,j)=(1,3) for example. On current row 1, the left boundary is at j=2. However, because matrix[1][3] is 1, you need to consider the left boundary on previous row as well, which is 3. So the real left boundary at (1,3) is 3.

The other is using stack, cited from https://leetcode.com/discuss/5198/a-o-n-2-solution-based-on-largest-rectangle-in-histogram

This question is similar as [Largest Rectangle in Histogram]:

You can maintain a row length of Integer array H recorded its height of '1's, and scan and update row by row to find out the largest rectangle of each row.

For each row, if matrix[row][i] == '1'. H[i] +=1, or reset the H[i] to zero. and accroding the algorithm of [Largest Rectangle in Histogram], to update the maximum area.

public class Solution {
    public int maximalRectangle(char[][] matrix) {
        if (matrix==null||matrix.length==0||matrix[0].length==0)
            return 0;
        int cLen = matrix[0].length;    // column length
        int rLen = matrix.length;       // row length
        // height array 
        int[] h = new int[cLen+1];
        h[cLen]=0;
        int max = 0;


        for (int row=0;row<rLen;row++) {
            Stack<Integer> s = new Stack<Integer>();
            for (int i=0;i<cLen+1;i++) {
                if (i<cLen)
                    if(matrix[row][i]=='1')
                        h[i]+=1;
                    else h[i]=0;

                if (s.isEmpty()||h[s.peek()]<=h[i])
                    s.push(i);
                else {
                    while(!s.isEmpty()&&h[i]<h[s.peek()]){
                        int top = s.pop();
                        int area = h[top]*(s.isEmpty()?i:(i-s.peek()-1));
                        if (area>max)
                            max = area;
                    }
                    s.push(i);
                }
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
