######Difficulty: `Medium`
This is a typical problem called high precision computing.
The main idea is that we need to simulate the Multiply process.
The key point is that the result length will not exceed the num1.size() + num2.size()
Furthermore, for the final result, we need to eliminiate the leading zeros.
