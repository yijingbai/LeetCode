This is the topology sort problem and can be done using DFS or BFS. The idea is that
there is at least one sink node in the DAG, there fore, we use DFS to find every sink node
and add it into the sorted list. After visited, we mark it as visited. And then, for the rest
node, we need to find the sink node again. And do it recursively. The on_path list in the code
is to prevent the loop in the graph. If it has, we can not find a topology result. And return null.
